# rhino-deinst
rhino-deinst (Rhino DE Installer) is a command-line utility script which provides a Terminal User Interface to install desktop environments on Ubuntu and Ubuntu based systems. This utility can be used in Debian, but there's no promises that everything will work, and no work will be done in Debian specifically. This used to be a utility in [Rolling Rhino Remix](https://rollingrhino.org/), but the project is about to reach EOL in favor of [Rhino Linux](https://rhinolinux.org/).
 
### Getting started
Run `rhino-deinst`. Use the up and down keys to navigate the list, press space to select/deselect DEs. Press enter to install them.
